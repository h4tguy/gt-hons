We disprove both statements by proving the following:

For every positive integer $k$, there is a $k$-connected graph which
is not hamiltonian.

We only need demonstrate such a graph. Consider $K_{k,k+1}$ with partite
sets $A$, $B$, such that $|A|=k$, $|B|=k+1$. Suppose for contradiction 
$x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{2k+1},x_1$ was a hamiltonian cycle and wlog $x_1\in A$.
Then $x_2 \in B$, $x_3 \in A$, \dots, $x_{2k+1} \in A$, but then
$x_{2k+1}x_1$ is an edge between vertices in $A$, a contradiction.
So $K_{k,k+1}$ is not hamiltonian. On the other hand, let $S$ be a
set of fewer than $k$ vertices of $K_{k,k+1}$. Then each of $A-S$ and
$B-S$ is nonempty, say $a \in A-S$ and $b \in B-S$.
Now $ab \in K_{k,k+1}-S$, every element of $A-S$ is adjacent to $b$ in
$K_{k,k+1}-S$ and every element of $B-S$ is adjacent to $a$ in
$K_{k,k+1}-S$, so $K_{k,k+1}-S$ is $k$-connected. Hence $K_{k,k+1}$ is
a $k$-connected graph that is not hamiltonian, and so both results
are false.
