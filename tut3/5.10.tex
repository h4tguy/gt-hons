Construct $H$ as in 5.9. Now note that $p(u,x)=\kappa(u,x)\ge \kappa(H)=k$,
so there exist $k$ internally disjoint paths from $u$ to $x$. The
penultimate vertex in each of these paths is a neighbour of $x$, hence 
a $v_i$ for some $i$, but these paths are internally disjoint, so each path
passes through exactly one $v_i$. Let $P_i'$ be the path passing through
$v_i$. Then $P_i$, the path consisting of every vertex of $P_i'$ except $x$,
is a $u-v_i$ path. Moreover, it is a subpath of $P_i'$, and the $P_i'$ are
internally disjoint so the $P_i$ are too. The $P_i$ are hence the required
paths, and the corollary is proved.
