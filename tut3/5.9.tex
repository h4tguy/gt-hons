We first show that if $S$ is a set of at most $k-1$ vertices
of $H$, then $H-S$ is connected.

Firstly note that $|V(G)\cap S| \le |S| = k-1$ so $G- (V(G)\cap S)$
is connected. We then have two cases:

If $x \in S$, then $H-S=G-(V(G)\cap S)$, so $H-S$ is connected and we
are done.

If $x \notin S$, then there is an $i$ such that $v_i \notin S$ (since
$|S|<k$). But then $x$ is connected to $v_i$, and hence to every other
vertex in $G-(V(G)\cap S)$ by transitivity. So every pair of vertices in
$V(H-S) = V(G-(V(G)\cap S))\cup\{x\}$ is connected and we are done.

Hence $\kappa(H) \ge k$. However 
$\kappa(H) \le \delta(H) \le \text{deg } x =k$ 
(Whitney's Theorem, \cite{notes} Theorem 24), so $\kappa(H) = k$.
