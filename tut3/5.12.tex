Let $G$ be a cubic graph. 

By Whitney's theorem we know that $\kappa(G) \le \lambda(G) \le \delta(G) = 3 $.

Assume that $S$ is a vertex-cut with $|S| = \kappa(G)$. Then
$G-S$ is disconnected into at least two components $X, Y$. 
We will now show that we can find a minimal edge-cut $T$ such that $|T| = |S|$.

If $\kappa(G) = 3$. $\kappa(G) = 3 \le \lambda(G) \le \delta(G) = 3$
then $\lambda(G) = 3 = \kappa(G)$ as required.

For the cases where $\kappa(G) \in \{1, 2\}$ we continue as follows:

If none of the vertices in $S$ are adjacent to each other we can do the following:
For every $x \in S$, $x$ is connected to either $X$ or $Y$ by at most one edge $e$. 
Add this edge to our edge-cut.

If $v_1, v_2 \in S$ are adjacent then $v_1$ has one edge incident to a vertex 
in $X$ and one edge incident to a vertex in $Y$. Similarly with $v_2$. Choose 
the edges of $v_1, v_2$ incident with $X$ to be in our edge-cut. If $|S| = 3$ 
choose the third edge of $v_3 \in S$ in the edge cut using the first method 
above. 

% If $v_1, v_2, v_3 \in S$ and $v_1v_2, v_2v_3 \in E(G)$ it is easy to see
% that removing $v_1, v_3$ disconnects the graph. 

For every vertex in our vertex cut we have inserted one edge into our edge
cut so $|S| = |T|$ as required. 

Let $x\in X, y \in Y$, a $x-y$ path would have to go through one of the
vertices in the vertex-cut $S$. For any such vertex $s \in S$ it is the
case that the edge from the component $X$ to $s$ has been removed or the
vertex from $s$ to the component $Y$ has been removed so no such path
exists, $X, Y$ is disconnected and $T$ is a vertex cut. 

$\kappa(G) = \lambda(G)$
