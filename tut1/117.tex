Let $v$ be a vertex in $G$. We count the vertices of $G$ by partitioning them into three subsets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\{v\}$, which has $1$ element.
\item The vertices adjacent to $v$. $G$ is $r$-regular, so $v$ has exactly $r$
neighbours.
\item The vertices non-adjacent to $v$, excluding $v$. These are exactly the
vertices adjacent to $v$ in $\overline{G}$, and since $\overline{G}$ is $r$-regular,
there are exactly $r$ vertices in this set.
\end{enumerate}
So the order of $G$ is $1+r+r=2r+1$, which is clearly odd.
