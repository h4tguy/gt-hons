\paragraph{a} This is not a degree sequence of a graph, as there would be an uneven number of vertices with uneven degrees.
\paragraph{b} This is not a degree sequence of a graph as, we see, applying the Havel-Hakimi theorem twice we get a negative integer in the sequence, which cannot be a degree sequence for a graph.
\paragraph{c} This is the degree sequence of a graph - this can be seen immediately from construction: Take $C_6$, the 6-vertex cycle, and join two of the edges. Then add two isolated vertices $v,w$ and join them with edge $vw$. This graph then has the desired degree sequence.
\paragraph{d} Iterations of HH-Theorem go as follows:
\subparagraph{0} 7,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1
\subparagraph{1}   3,2,2,1,1,1,0,1,1
\subparagraph{2}     1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1 which is, of course (with rearrangement), the degree sequence of the graph of $3K_2$ with 2 isolated vertices added.
