The order of $Q_t$ is the number of vertices. This is equal to $|\{0,1\}^t| = 2^t$.
The size of $Q_t$ is the number of edges. Each vertex is connected to the vertices
differing from it in exactly one place. Since each vertex is a $t$-tuple, the
degree of each vertex is $t$ and
the size of the graph is $t 2^{t-1}$ by the first theorem of graph theory.
