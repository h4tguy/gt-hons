Suppose $G$ has a cutvertex $v$. Then $G-v$ has at least two components. 
Then since $\text{deg}\ v=3$, by Pigeonhole Principle
there is a component $U$ of $G-v$ which is joined
to $v$ by a single edge. This edge is then a bridge, since removing it
disconnects $U$ from $v$.

Now suppose $G$ has a bridge. Also $G$ has at least one vertex $v$. But 
$\text{deg}\ v=3$, so $G$ has at least four vertices. So,
by Lemma 12 \cite{notes}, $G$ has a cutvertex.
