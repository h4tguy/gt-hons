Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ with $\delta \left(G\right) \geq \frac{n-1}{2}$. We prove by contradiction:\\*assume $G$ is not connected i.e. it can be partitioned into at least 2 components,\\* of which are $G_1$ and $G_2$. Without loss of generality, let $G_2$ be the component\\* with the least number of vertices, and let $v \in G_2$.\\ Let $N\left(v\right)$ denote the neighbourhood of $v$ (i.e. the set of $v$'s adjacent vertices).\\* By assumption, $|N\left(v\right)| \geq \frac{n-1}{2}$ which implies $|V\left(G_2\right)| \geq \frac{n-1}{2} + 1 = \frac{n+1}{2}$.\\* This implies that $|V\left(G_2\right) \cup V\left(G_1\right)| \geq \frac{n+1}{2} \times 2 = n+1 > n$.\\* This contradiction proves the claim.
