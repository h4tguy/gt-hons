Suppose $T$ has $k$ vertices of degree $3$ and $n-k$ of degree $1$. Then,
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{array}{rlll}
		\sum_{v \in V(T)} \text{deg}\ v &=& 2m & \text{(\cite{notes}, Theorem 1)}\\
		3k+(n-k) &=& 2(n-1) & \text{(\cite{notes}, Theorem 18)}\\
2k &=& n-2 &\\
k &=&\frac{n-2}{2} &
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
as required.
