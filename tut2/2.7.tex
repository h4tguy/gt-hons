Let $G$ be a disconnected graph. Then $G$ can be broken up into distinct (connected) components $U_1, U_2, \dots ,U_k$ for some positive integer $k$. This implies that for any vertex $v_i \in U_i$ and $v_j \in U_j$ we have that $d_{\bar{G}}\left(v_i, v_j\right) = 1$ provided that $ i \neq j$. This means that, choosing $v_i , v'_i \in U_i$ we can construct a path $P: v_i, v_j, v'_i$ of length 2. Hence, for vertices $u,v$ in G we have that $d\left(u,v\right) = 2$ iff $u$ and $v$ are in the same component, otherwise $d\left(u,v\right) = 1$.
