Let $G$ be a disconnected graph. Then $\exists k > 0$ such that $G$ can be partitioned
into distinct (connected) components $U_1, U_2, \dots ,U_k$. So for any vertex $v_i \in U_i$ 
and $v_j \in U_j$ we have $d_{\bar{G}}\left(v_i, v_j\right) = 1$  whenever $ i \neq j$, since they are not adjacent
in $G$. Choosing $v_i , v'_i \in U_i$ we can construct a path $P: v_i, v_j, v'_i$ of length 2
in $\bar{G}$. Hence, for vertices $u,v$ in $G$ we have that $d_{\bar{G}}\left(u,v\right) = 2$  implies
$u$ and $v$ are in the same component;  otherwise for all $u,v$ we must have 
$d_{\bar{G}}\left(u,v\right) = 1$ since it must be less than 2.

This means that the diameter of $\bar{G}$ cannot be greater than 2,
the length of its longest geodesic.
