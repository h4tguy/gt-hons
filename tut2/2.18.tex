    \item ($\implies$) Assume that $D$ is not strongly connected. Then there
			exist $u, v \in V(D)$ such that there is no $u-v$ path in $D$. Then
			$d(u, v) = \infty = \max\{d(u, v) : v \in V(D)\}$. So $D$ has
			infinite out-eccentricity. \\
    ($\impliedby$) Assume that $D$ is strongly connected. Let $u \in V(D)$ 
		then for every $v \in V(D)$ there exists a $u-v$ path since $D$ is strongly
		connected and $d(u, v)$ is finite (the length of the minimum $u-v$ path and
		we know there's at least one). Therefore every vertex has finite out-eccentricity.

            \begin{figure}[H]

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{218.png}
            \end{figure}
            \item From the figure above we can see that  $$e^+(u) = \max \{d(u, x) : x \in V(G)\} = 1$$ and $$e^+(v) = \max \{d(v, x) : x \in V(G)\} = 4$$ 
                So $|e^+(u) - e^+(v)| = 4 > 1$,
                disproving the proposition.
            \item Relabeling the figure above by swapping $u$ and $v$ then 
             $$e^+(v) = \max \{d(v, x) : x \in V(G)\} = 1$$ and $$e^+(u) = \max \{d(u, x) : x \in V(G)\} = 4$$ 
                So $|e^+(u) - e^+(v)| = |1 - 4| = |-3| = 3 > 1$
        \end{enumerate}
