\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item ($\implies$) Assume that $D$ is not strongly connected. Then there exists $u, v \in V(D)$ such that there is no $u-v$ path in $D$. Then $d(u, v) = \infty = \max\{d(u, v) : v \in V(D)\}$. So $D$ has infinite-eccentricity. \\
    ($\impliedby$) Assume that $D$ is strongly connected. Let $u \in V(D)$ then for every $v \in V(D)$ there exists a $u-v$ path since $D$ is strongly connected and $d(u, v)$ is finite (the length of the minimum $u-v$ path and we know there's at least one). $\implies$ every vertex has finite eccentricity.
