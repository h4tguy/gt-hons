Let $G$ be a connected graph with cut-vertex $v$. Then $G-v$ can be partitioned into connected
subgraphs $U_1, \ldots , U_k$ for $k >= 2$.

Let $u_1 \in U_1$ and $u_2 \in U_2$. Then every $u_1 - u_2$ path in $G$ goes through $v$. Since
$u_1u_2 \notin G$, $u_1u_2 \in \overline{G}$ so $u_1, u_2$ are in the same component within $G-v$.

Let $u_1, u_2 \in U_1$ and $z \in U_2$ then $u_1z, u_2z \in \overline{G}-v$ and $(u_1, z, u_2)$ is
a $u_1 - u_2$ path and $v$ is not a cut vertex.
